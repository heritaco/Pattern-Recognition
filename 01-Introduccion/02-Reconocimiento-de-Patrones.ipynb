    "## **Definition of Pattern**  \n",
    "A **pattern** is a structured or recognizable arrangement of data that can be described quantitatively or qualitatively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In pattern recognition, a **pattern** refers to a set of features or measurements that represent an object or event. It is what the system aims to classify, cluster, or analyze.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Formal Definition:**  \n",
    "A pattern can be defined as an **n-dimensional feature vector**:  \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where each \\( x_i \\) is a measurable characteristic (feature) of the object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples of Patterns:**  \n",
    "- A handwritten digit (recognized by a machine as a number).  \n",
    "- A speech signal (recognized as words).  \n",
    "- A medical image (classified as normal or abnormal).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns are fundamental in **machine learning, classification, and clustering** tasks."

    "## **Pattern Recognition**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**  \n",
    "Pattern recognition is the scientific discipline whose goal is the classification of objects (patterns) into several categories (classes).  \n",
    "- It is an integral part of most machine learning systems.  \n",
    "- A **class** is a collection of objects that are similar (in some way) to each other and are distinguished from objects of another class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Features**  \n",
    "**Features** are the measurable variables that characterize an object, which can be represented as a vector with **l** elements.  \n",
    "- Each feature vector uniquely identifies a single pattern (object).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Feature Vectors**  \n",
    "A **feature vector** can be interpreted, in general, as:  \n",
    "- A point in a vector space of dimension **l**.  \n",
    "- A random vector within a set of possible states.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_l)^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Partitions**  \n",
    "A **partition** of a set $S$ is a collection of non-empty subsets $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_n$ such that:  \n",
    "1. $S_i \\cap S_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$ (the subsets are disjoint).  \n",
    "2. $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} S_i = S$ (the subsets together cover the entire set).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In pattern recognition, a partitioning strategy is often used to divide data into different groups or classes for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Random Variable**  \n",
    "A **random variable** $X$ is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space $\\Omega$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be **discrete** (taking a countable number of values) or **continuous** (taking an uncountable range of values).  \n",
    "- Formally, a random variable is a measurable function:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  X: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x)\n",

    "### **Desirable Characteristics of Features:**  \n",
    "1. **Robust** – Not sensitive to noise.  \n",
    "2. **Discriminant** – Objects belonging to different classes possess distinct features.  \n",

    "A pattern recognition system generally follows these stages:  \n",
    "1. **Data acquisition** – Collecting raw data from sensors, images, or signals.  \n",
    "2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaning and normalizing the data (e.g., removing noise).  \n",
    "3. **Feature extraction** – Selecting the most informative characteristics of the data.  \n",
    "4. **Classification** – Assigning labels based on extracted features.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Approaches**  \n",
    "   - These rely on an explicit underlying **probability model**.  \n",
    "   - The decision boundaries are determined by the **probability distribution** of objects belonging to each class.  \n",
    "   - Examples: **Bayesian classifiers, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nonmetric Approaches**  \n",
    "   - These do not assume an explicit probability model.  \n",
    "   - Classification is based on **decision trees** and **rule-based classifiers**.  \n",
    "   - The process involves a series of questions, where each question depends on the answer to the previous one.  \n",
    "   - This approach is useful for **nonmetric (categorical) data**.  \n",
    "   - Examples: **Decision trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and rule-based systems**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cognitive Approaches**  \n",
    "   - These are inspired by human cognitive processes and include advanced machine learning models.  \n",
    "   - Examples:  \n",
    "     - **Neural Networks** – Artificial models mimicking brain neurons.  \n",
    "     - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** – Use hyperplanes to separate classes.  \n",
